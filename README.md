## Hiawatha Comic Book Store

The Hiawatha Comic Book Store is a basic, one-page React.js app. It allows the user to add new products via the entry form and calculate the price of items put into the shopping cart.

## Motivation

The project was made during the penultimate week of the IT Bootcamp's Front End Development Course as the first experiment with databases (db.JSON) and axios.

## Build status

The project is considered finished, and there won't be any expansions in terms of features. I might add a couple more items to the product list in the future.That said, the project was overhauled recently with responsive design and extra shopping items.

## Tech/framework used

This project is based on React.js, with a couple of well-known libraries.

<b>Built with</b>
Aside from React.js, I also used

- [db.json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/db-json)
  The database is live, and it's deployed on heroku.com. The live project is on netlify.com, and it is connected to the live database.

- [axios](https://www.axios.com/)
- [react router 5](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)

## Features

Main features of this app include:

- fetching/displaying the list of products
  The user can add new products to the database via the product form in the upper portion of the page.

- calculating the price of the shopping cart
  The user can also add any of the displayed products to the cart, which automatically calculates the total price. "-" and "+" buttons allow the user to decrease and increase the amounts for every individual item separately. The Show Info button displays and hides the product description.
